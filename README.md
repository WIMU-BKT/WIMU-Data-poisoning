# WIMU-Data-poisoning
Project developed as an approach to introduce data poisoning in audio-focused AI models.
## Research
### Approach
Based on our research, we tend to focus on fine-tuning pre-trained text-to-audio (we also consider text-to-speech) models rather than training a clear model on huge datasets. The main factor is long time required to achieve so and need to use sophisticated graphic cards. Based on paper describing Nightshade we think that our approach is reasonable and even closer to real conditions.
